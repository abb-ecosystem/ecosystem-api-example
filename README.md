WebApp example for usage of an Ecosystem-API and TComponents for accessing the OmniCore App SDK and additional RWS for the ABB Omnicore controllers.

## Installation in a virtual controller on Robot Studio

Create a Robotstudio project containing a robot and Omnicore virtual controller, e.g. CRB 15000. Once the controller is up and running, copy the whole "tcomponents-example" folder into the virtual controller's "HOME/WebApps/". Direct access to the HOME directory can be achive by right clicking at the HOME folder under Controller View and selecting "Open folder".

Open (or restart) the FlexPendant under Controller View and you will find the new installed "TComponents_Template" webapp.
