# AppStudio Prototype Examples

This directory contains examples for using the AppStudio prototype. The project includes a `.webapp` file and a set of component files located in the `CComponents` folder. Additionally, there may be an `images` folder containing necessary images.

## Usage Instructions

Follow these steps to use the AppStudio prototype examples:

### 1. Import Images into a Gallery Template

1. If an image gallery template does not exist yet, create an ImageGallery (or other name) template by right-mouse click on an empty view container and selecting "Create template".
2. Import all images into the gallery template by dragging and dropping an image item, then selecting the image to be imported in the Property section.
3. In TreeView do a right-mouse click on the ImageGallery and select "Save changes".

### 2. Import the Components

1. In AppStudio Prototype's main menu, go to Files and select "Import component".
2. Import all `.js` component files into your AppStudio project.

### 3. RAPID modules and configuration files

1. If any RAPID module or RobotStudio configuration file is available in the example, make sure to load them into the controller before opening the AppStudio project. This can be done directly with RobotStudio

### 4. Open the Project

1. Ensure that all components and images are already correctly loaded.
2. Open the `.webapp` file in your AppStudio project by navigating to File --> Open Project.

By following these steps, you will be able to use the AppStudio prototype examples effectively.
In order to check/modify the content of the components go to "Component Creator" and select the corresponding component. The corresponding code is then accessable in the code editor. Any change is then effective after clicking on "Save".
